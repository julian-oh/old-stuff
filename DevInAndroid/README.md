This was my actual finished Android app. This had caused me alot of frustrations since I was working with no internet and there was no fun reward at all. On top of that, it's really bloated, I used LibGDX and the IDE/Compiler I was using doesn't support culling unused classes, so... it's like 2.4 MB, which I didn't liked.
